# stats.quake.com API Wrapper
A python library wrapping stats.quake.com

## Using
Currently this library is not packaged for PIP etc. That is TBA.

This library depends on the Python library **requests**

## Why
stats.quake.com is still in BETA, but I hope this library can allow people to fearlessly begin making content using the stats with what will hpefully be a consistent interface.

## The Future
My documentation of the API is still in its infancy. Ideally we will have official documentation, but for now any improvements to the clarity of my documentation would be appreciated.

Better documentation and packaging in general are things that I would love guidance on. I would also appreciate feedback on the model used (SimpleNamespace wrappings of json data) and how people find this to use.
